;;DEFINITION
/**
 * Picture — reserved R4 class home, not an implementation.
 *
 * Image-display widget with borrowed Image backing, UV crop and contain/cover/stretch policy.
 *
 * This draft currently owns no storage or borrowed resources and executes no
 * behavior. Before implementation, specify lifetime/ownership, failure results,
 * constructor arities and applicable property/event contracts. Rendering,
 * platform resources and scheduling stay with their existing R1/R3 owners.
 * Widget behavior belongs in its class; shared operations belong in properties/.
 * No blanket event opt-in, fabricated success result or duplicate driver is
 * introduced by this scaffold. The draft marker stays until real lab evidence
 * supports the implemented scope; appearance approval belongs to the user.
 */

;;OVERVIEW
/**
 * CLASS: Picture (drawable/picture.c)
 * STATUS: draft scaffold; zero implemented runtime capabilities.
 * TYPE: opaque declaration in the paired header; no struct fields defined.
 * PUBLIC API: the forward type declaration only; no callable functions declared or defined.
 * PRIVATE HELPERS: none defined.
 * IMPLEMENT NEXT: Image-display widget with borrowed Image backing, UV crop and contain/cover/stretch policy.
 * LAB PROOF NOW: source/header compilation only, never runtime readiness.
 * LAB PROOF LATER: constructors, ownership/teardown, failure/boundary cases,
 * property routing and captured-pixel/input oracles where applicable.
